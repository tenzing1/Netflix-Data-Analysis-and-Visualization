# Netflix-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project involved a comprehensive exploration of Netflix data to uncover key insights into content popularity and user engagement. By performing detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), we identified significant trends that reflect viewing behaviors and preferences on the platform. Advanced visualization techniques were applied to effectively present these insights, providing valuable support for strategic decision-making related to content management and platform performance optimization. The project highlights the power of data-driven analysis in understanding user engagement and enhancing content strategies.
